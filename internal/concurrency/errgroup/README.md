# Understanding Go's `errgroup` Package: Group

The `errgroup` package in Go provides a straightforward way to manage the lifecycle of a group of goroutines, and their associated error handling.

## Introduction to Group

The `errgroup.Group` type provides synchronization, error propagation, and Context cancelation for groups of goroutines working on sub-tasks of a common task.

## Usage of Group

```go
g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(context.Background())

g.Go(func() error {
    // Your code here
    return nil  // return an error if something goes wrong
})

// Wait for all goroutines to finish and collect any errors
err := g.Wait()
```

## Use Cases

- **Concurrent Error Handling**: Executing multiple goroutines and aggregating their errors.
- **Context Propagation**: Propagating context and cancellation signals across a group of goroutines.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Error Ignorance**: Ignoring errors returned by `Group.Go`.
- **Misusing Context**: Misusing the context returned by `errgroup.WithContext` can lead to unintended behavior. For instance, storing values in the context that are supposed to be accessed by goroutines may lead to race conditions if not handled properly.

## Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors returned by `Group.Go`.
- **Context Usage**: Use the context returned by `errgroup.WithContext` to propagate cancelation.
